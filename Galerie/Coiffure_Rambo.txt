The highest priority is to maintain the exact facial features, likeness, and perceived gender of the person in the provided reference photo. Keeping the original photo's composition, style the person's hair to be a perfect example of Rambo. If the person's hair already has this style, enhance and perfect it. Do not alter the person's core facial structure, clothing, or the background.
