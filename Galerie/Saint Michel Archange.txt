Ultra-realistic full-body shot of a male archangel attached in the uploaded reference image ( Keep the face of the person 100% accurate from the reference image ) in real physical armour, captured with a high-end DSLR camera. Natural skin texture, real pores, real hair strands, no painting look. His wings are large, white, and completely lifelike, with individual feathers visible in sharp detail. Armour is practical metal plating with real weathering, scratches, dents, and engraved gold inlays that look physically carved. Cloth pieces appear like real worn fabric with frayed edges. The lighting is cinematic and grounded, similar to a real film set, soft directional light from above creating natural shadows. The sword is solid metal with weight and texture. Background is a deep red studio backdrop with a real carved metal halo behind him—no illustration style, looks like an actual sculpted object photographed in a studio. Expression serious and human. High dynamic range, crisp realism, zero digital painting, zero fantasy art style. Looks like a real photographed man dressed as an archangel for a movie.
