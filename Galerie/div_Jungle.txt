Consigne primordiale : Conserver les traits du visage et créer la scene suivante dans laquelle on doit parfaitement reconnaitre la personne de la photo de référence (visage et cheveux): 

Cinematic close-up portrait of a rugged young male adventurer, mid-twenties aesthetic, caught in a torrential downpour deep within a dense, wet tropical jungle. He wears a soiled, sweat-soaked beige cotton t-shirt and heavy leather backpack straps, suggesting intense exertion and immediate danger. His face is slick with water, his hair matted, and streaks of crimson blood run dramatically from his hairline down his cheek, emphasizing a recent injury and high stakes. His eyes are wide with acute alertness and tension, focused slightly off-camera right.

The composition uses a wide cinematic aspect ratio (16:9) with a shallow depth of field (f/1.8), isolating the sharp focus on the subject’s face while the background dissolves into atmospheric bokeh.

**Lighting and Mood:** Extreme high-contrast, dramatic cinematic lighting. A powerful, warm golden key light acts as dramatic backlighting and rim light, cutting through the darkness of the canopy. This intense light catches every individual rain streak and droplet, creating dazzling specular highlights on his wet skin, shoulders, and the glossy foliage. The background is steeped in dark, cool, saturated emerald greens and teals, contrasting sharply with the warm light on the subject (Chiaroscuro effect). The mood is intense, suspenseful, and adrenaline-fueled survivalist cinema.

**Background:** Dense, impenetrable jungle environment dominated by dark, wet foliage, hanging vines, and atmospheric mist. The far background is dark and indistinct, focusing all attention on the illuminated foreground action.

**Technical Aesthetics:** Ultra-detailed 8K resolution film still quality, shot with a high-end prime lens (85mm), volumetric lighting, subtle film grain, cinematic realism, production still quality.
