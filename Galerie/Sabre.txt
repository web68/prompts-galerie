Ultra-realistic cinematic scene of a man attached in the uploaded reference image ( Keep the face of the person 100% accurate from the reference image ) standing in a crowded dimly lit dojo, holding a katana in the exact same pose as the reference—blade raised horizontally at eye level, hands gripping the hilt firmly, elbows bent, and shoulders tense; the man’s eyes locked forward with an intense focused stare. He wears a worn yellow martial-arts track jacket with black stripes on the sleeves, sweat and dirt marks visible on the fabric. Lighting is warm, golden, and atmospheric, coming from overhead lantern-style sources, casting soft highlights on the katana’s polished metal and creating dramatic shadows across his face. Background is slightly blurred with a crowd of figures watching, all in muted dark clothing, maintaining the same depth of field and cinematic balance as the reference. The katana must appear razor-sharp with subtle edge reflections, and the man’s expression must be serious, battle-ready, and unwavering. The environment includes wooden walls, traditional Japanese décor, and low ambient light, all contributing to a tense, pre-fight mood.
