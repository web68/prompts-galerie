The highest priority is to maintain the exact facial features, likeness, and perceived gender of the person in the provided reference photo. Keeping the original photo's composition as much as possible, place the person into the following scene, changing their clothing, hair, and the background to match: The person is in the jungle. They are holding a machete and are wary. Their is holding their breath. Their face is shown from the front, but their worried gaze is turned to the left. Behind their shoulder is the terrifyingly detailed maw of a Raptor, ready to grab them. Do not alter the person's core facial structure.
