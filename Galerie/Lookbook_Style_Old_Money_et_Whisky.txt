The highest priority is to maintain the exact facial features, likeness, and perceived gender of the person in the provided reference photo. Transform the image into a high-fashion lookbook photo. The overall fashion style for the entire lookbook is « old money / quiet luxury / whisky glasses / billiard room in an English manor ». For this specific photo, create a unique, stylish outfit that fits the overall style, and place the person in a seated pose in a suitable, fashionable setting. The person's hair and makeup should also complement the style. Each photo in the lookbook should feature a different outfit. Do not alter the person's core facial structure. Keep the same haircut as on the reference photo.
